# Observability stack

The config files in this directory go together with `docker-compose.observability.yaml` and provide
a reference for a potential observability stack.

**Disclaimer**

The chosen vendors/technologies here merely serve as an example - it's simply a stack we're somewhat
comfortable with. Open Zaak itself is vendor agnostic and the principles demonstrated apply to
competing vendors too.

## Bringing up the services

From the root of the repository:

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.observability.yaml up
```

You can now navigate to:

- http://localhost:3000 for Grafana
- http://localhost:3100/ready for Loki readiness
- http://localhost:3100/metrics for Loki metrics

## Logging

For log scraping, parsing and querying we've set up Promtail as scraper, Loki as storage and Grafana
as visualization tool.

### Sample queries

In the Grafana menu, navigate to "Explore" to create ad-hoc queries.

**Web service logs**

```logql
{job="docker", app="open-zaak"} | json | __error__ = ""
```

This ignores logs that cannot be parsed as JSON (such as container/server startup logs).

**Logs for a single request**

You can filter application logs based on a request ID:

```logql
{job="docker", app="open-zaak"} | json | __error__ = "" | request_id=`1e9e1b9d-4d34-4657-99e4-88673d824724`
```
