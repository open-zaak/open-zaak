Manual
======

.. note::
    The manual is currently only available in the Dutch language!

Once Open Zaak is :ref:`installed<installation_index>`, it needs to be
configured to make all API's accessible and allow inter-communication.

In addition, you can manage the data that is exposed in the Catalogi API
directly in the management interface.
