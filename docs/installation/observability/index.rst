Observability
=============

Observability is an umbrella term for a number of principles and technologies to get
insight in running (distributed) systems. It typically focuses on Metrics, Logging and
Tracing, which provide insight in:

* what the application is doing, in particular as part of a larger system, such as
  microservice environments
* performance of the system
* how the system is used

Open Zaak operates in distributed environments, and being able to fully trace a
customer request from start to end, observability tools are crucial. Below we provide
some additional context for infastructure teams that wish to integrate Open Zaak in
their observability stack.
