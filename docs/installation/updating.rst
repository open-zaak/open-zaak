Updating an Open Zaak installation
==================================

Software receives new features and bugfixes all the time, and Open Zaak is no different.
At some point, you'll want to update to a newer version of Open Zaak - be it a patch
version with bugfixes or a feature release to upgrade to.

Before you actually upgrade, we strongly advise you to take a look at the
:ref:`development_changelog` to spot any breaking changes or required manual
interventions.

.. note::
    We always recommend you to have taken and tested your backups in case something
    goes wrong, BEFORE performing any updates.

.. note::
    We encourage having multiple environments such as staging and production, completely
    isolated from each other. This allows you to test out the update on a staging
    environment to check if anything goes wrong, without affecting production.
