Container health checks
=======================

Open Zaak is deployed as a collection of containers.
Containers can be checked if they're running as expected, and actions can be taken by
the container runtime or container orchestration (like Kubernetes and Docker) when that's not the case,
like restarting the container or removing it from the pool that serves traffic.

Health checks are responsible for detecting anomalies and reporting that a container is
not running as expected. They can take different forms, for example:

* running a script and checking the exit code of the process
* making an HTTP request to an endpoint which responds with a success or error status
  code
* opening a TCP connection to a particular port

This section of the documentation describes the recommended health checks to use that
are provided in Open Zaak, or the health checks to implement in containers of third
party software typically used in an Open Zaak deployment. You can incorporate these in
your infrastructure code (like Helm charts).

You can find code examples of these health checks in our `docker-compose.yml`_ on Github.

Open Zaak containers
====================

HTTP service
------------

The Open Zaak web service listens on port 8000 inside the container and accepts HTTP
traffic. Three endpoints are exposed for health checks.

``http://localhost:8000/_healthz/livez/``
    The liveness endpoint - checks that HTTP requests can be handled. Suitable for
    liveness (and readiness) probes. This is the check with lowest overhead.

``http://localhost:8000/_healthz/``
    Endpoint that checks connections with database, caches, database migration state...

    Suitable for the startup probe. The most expensive check to run, as it checks all
    dependencies of the application.

``http://localhost:8000/_healthz/readyz/``
    The readiness endpoint - checks that requests can be handled and tests that the
    default cache (used by for sessions) and database connection function. Slightly
    more expensive than the liveness check, but it's a good candidate for the readiness
    probe.

.. tip:: Ensure the ``ALLOWED_HOSTS`` environment variable contains ``localhost``. See
    :ref:`installation_env_config` for more details.

.. tip:: The executable ``maykin-common`` is available in the container which can be
   used to perform the health checks, as an alternative to HTTP probes.

   .. code-block:: bash

        maykin-common health-check \
            --endpoint=http://localhost:8000/_healthz/livez/ \
            --timeout=3

Celery workers
--------------

The Celery Worker service is responsible for picking up and executing background tasks
scheduled by the web service or Celery beat.

The worker creates and updates an event loop liveness file at
``/app/tmp/celery_worker_event_loop.live``, which is touched every minute. Additionally,
when the worker is ready to accept tasks, it creates the
``/app/tmp/celery_worker.ready`` file and removes it when the worker shuts down.

The worker liveness can be checked with the ``maykin-common`` CLI:

.. code-block:: bash

    maykin-common worker-health-check \
        --broker redis://redis:6379/0 \
        --liveness-file /app/tmp/celery_worker_event_loop.live \
        --worker-name celery@docker

.. caution:: Adapt the ``--broker`` and ``--worker-name`` options to your environment.

    * ``--broker`` must match the value of the ``CELERY_BROKER``
      :ref:`setting <installation_env_config>`.
    * ``--worker-name`` should not be necessary as it is taken from the
      ``CELERY_WORKER_NAME`` envvar if set, and otherwise falls back to
      ``celery@<hostname>``, where the hostname of the container is used.

      If pings are failing, you may need to provide the worker name(s) explicitly.

.. tip:: You can also use the health checks for readiness in rolling deployments on
   Kubernetes, so that old pods are only stopped when the new versions are confirmed to
   be ready.

   .. code-block:: bash

       maykin-common worker-health-check \
        --skip-ping \
        --skip-event-loop-liveness \
        --no-skip-readiness \
        --readiness-file /app/tmp/celery_worker.ready

Celery beat
-----------

The Open Zaak Beat service is responsible for periodically scheduling background
tasks. It touches a liveness file at ``/app/tmp/celery_beat.live`` in
the container every time a task is successfully scheduled.

Liveness and readiness can be checked with the ``maykin-common`` CLI:

.. code-block:: bash

     maykin-common beat-health-check \
         --file=/app/tmp/celery_beat.live \
         --max-age=120

The ``CELERY_BEAT_SCHEDULE`` setting (in :mod:`openzaak.conf.base`) contains some tasks
that run every minute (60 seconds). The ``--max-age`` of 120 seconds covers 2 minutes
and should account for some time skew.

.. tip:: On Kubernetes, you can use this same check for the startup probe, but with a
   larger ``--max-age`` or delay the probe about 10 seconds to allow the application
   some time to load and initialize.

Celery flower
-------------

Celery Flower is a web-app which binds to port ``5555`` by default. You can use the
generic HTTP health check utility from ``maykin-common``, or set up an equivalent
HTTP probe:

.. code-block:: bash

     maykin-common health-check \
         --endpoint=http://localhost:5555/ \
         --timeout=3

Third party containers
======================

Redis
-----

The Redis container images include a command line utility - ``redis-cli`` which
has a ``ping`` command to test connectivity to the server:

.. code-block:: bash

    redis-cli ping

The command exits with exit code ``0`` on success and exit code ``1`` on failure.

PostgreSQL
----------

.. warning:: Running the database as a container can bring certain scaling and disaster
   recovery challenges. We only provide this check for completeness sake.

PostgreSQL container images typically include the ``pg_isready`` binary, which tests
the database connection (accepting traffic on the specified host and port). It has a
non-zero exit code when the database is not ready.

nginx
-----

nginx proxies HTTP traffic from the browser/client to the backend service. It also
serves static assets directly. The nginx config needs to be extended with location
handlers for the health checks. This ensures that the health endpoints are not accessible
from outside.

Example nginx configuration snippet:

.. code-block:: nginx

    location = /_healthz/ {
        access_log off;
        add_header Content-Type text/plain;
        # block outside traffic
        allow 127.0.0.1;
        allow ::1;
        deny all;
        return 200 "ok\n";
    }

    location = /_healthz/livez/ {
        access_log off;
        add_header Content-Type text/plain;
        # block outside traffic
        allow 127.0.0.1;
        allow ::1;
        deny all;
        return 200 "ok\n";
    }

    location = /_healthz/readyz/ {
        access_log off;
        add_header Content-Type text/plain;
        # block outside traffic
        allow 127.0.0.1;
        allow ::1;
        deny all;
        return 200 "ok\n";
    }


We recommend this cheap check for both the liveness and readiness checks.

You can then wire up an HTTP probe or ``curl`` script to make a ``GET`` call to
``http://localhost:8080/_healthz/livez/``. Note the port number - often the nginx
unprivileged image will be used, which binds to 8080 by default, but check your
specific environment to confirm.

**Smart readiness probe**

You *may* want to consider proxying to the backend-service for the readiness check.

.. warning:: This can lead to cascading failures where first your backend-service
   becomes unavailable, which leads to nginx becoming unavailable and possible other
   dependent services.

.. tip:: Even if the backend is not available, nginx may still be performing useful work
   by serving static files.

Example nginx configuration snippet:

.. code-block:: nginx

    location = /_healthz/readyz/ {
        access_log off;
        # block outside traffic
        allow 127.0.0.1;
        allow ::1;
        deny all;

        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $server_name;
        proxy_set_header X-Scheme $scheme;
        proxy_pass   http://web:8000/_health/readyz/;
    }
