        This function can be overwritten by passing one into the init, which
        might be necessary in some cases. Overwriting it might require some
        complexities, such as needing to reimplement existing filter logic.
        The default implementation here applies each filter to the queryset,
        then calls a *magical* QuerySet._next_is_sticky() function
        (ref: https://blog.ionelmc.ro/2014/05/10/django-sticky-queryset-filters/).
        `_next_is_sticky()` has the effect of combining the next `qs.filter()`
        call as an AND instead of an OR, which is the counter-intuitive default
        for django orm. Note that this will break if any of the dependent filter
        functions call qs.filter multiple times, which might be a reasonable
        thing to do depending on the filter's use-case (e.g. unioning several
        qs.filter() calls). If that is the case, overwriting this function is
        supported as an escape hatch, tho it might be worth arguing to rewrite
        the filter in question - filters that need do this kind of thing should
        be expressable as Q()s that get built up and applied via one qs.filter()
        function.
