# Check the health of a Celery worker.
#
# The worker process writes and periodically touches a number of files that indicate it
# is available and still healthy. If the worker becomes unhealthy for any reason, the
# timestamp of when the heartbeat file was last touched will not update and the delta
# becomes too big, allowing (container) orchestration to terminate and restart the
# worker process.
#
# Example usage with Kubernetes, as a liveness probe:
#
# .. code-block:: yaml
#
#       livenessProbe:
#         exec:
#           command:
#           - python
#           - /app/bin/check_celery_worker_liveness.py
#         initialDelaySeconds: 10
#         periodSeconds: 30  # must be smaller than `MAX_WORKER_LIVENESS_DELTA`
#
# Reference: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/#define-a-liveness-command
#
# Supported environment variables:
#
# * ``MAX_WORKER_LIVENESS_DELTA``: maximum delta between heartbeats before reporting
#   failure, in seconds. Defaults to 60 (one minute).
